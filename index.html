          <h1>Console Project</h1>
          <p>Visual Studios is a platform where we can code and make various types of websites.
            We can edit code and is optimised for building and debugging modern web and cloud applications.
            It is developed by microsoft cooperation. 
          </p>
          <p>The console is an operating system window where users interact with the operating system or with a text-based console 
            application by entering text input through the computer keyboard, and by reading text output from the computer terminal.
            To open the console in Chrome, use this keyboard shortcut: "Cmd + Option + J" (on a Mac) or "Ctrl +Shift +J" (on Windows).
            As an alternative, you can right-click on the webpage and click "Inspect" to open the developer console.
